# **ccna-srwe-case-study**

This project uses GNS3 and PacketTracer to create a network based on a case
study assigned as the final practical skills assessment for my
CCNA: Switching, Routing, and Wireless Essentials course.
The case study was designed to test skills gained throughout the course and
required that I build and configure a complex network on physical equipment.
